      <p>
        This document defines the concept of an "image resource" and a
        corresponding WebIDL {{ImageResource}} dictionary. Web APIs can use the
        {{ImageResource}} dictionary to represent an image resource in contexts
        where an `HTMLImageElement` is not suitable or available (e.g., in a
        Worker).

        <strong>This specification is not stable.</strong> Implementors who are
        not taking part in the discussions will find the specification changing

      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        Web applications often accept developer-provided image resources to be
        displayed outside of a HTML document (e.g., in the OS, in the browser
        UI, etc.). This specification defines a WebIDL dictionary that
        describes an image, and where that image resource can be fetched from.
        The user agent can then use this extra information to choose an image
        that is best suited to display on the end-user's device or most closely
        matches the end-user's preferences or environment.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Privacy and security considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        [=Fetching an image resource=] can reveal the user's IP address. It is
        RECOMMENDED that user agents fetch the chosen [=image resources=] when
        provided by the developer, and store them for re-use if needed. This
        limits tracking the user's location over time.

        An <dfn data-export="">image resource</dfn> consists of:

      <dl>
        <dt>
          <dfn data-dfn-for="image resource">src</dfn>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          A [=URL=] from where to obtain the image data.

        <dt>
          <dfn data-dfn-for="image resource">sizes</dfn>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          An optional [=string=] representing the sizes of the image, expressed
          using the same syntax as [^link^]'s [^link/sizes^] attribute.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <dfn data-dfn-for="image resource">type</dfn>

        <dd>

        <dt>
          <dfn data-dfn-for="image resource">label</dfn>

        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        In an API, an [=image resource=] is represented as an {{ImageResource}}
        dictionary.
      </p>
      <p>
        In [[JSON]], [=image resource=] is represented as an object.

        <p>
          The {{ImageResource/src}} of an {{ImageResource}} is a [=URL=] from
          which a user agent can [=fetch=] image data.
        </p>

          <dfn>sizes</dfn> member
        </h3>
        <p>
          The {{ImageResource/sizes}} member is equivalent to a [^link^]
          element's [^link/sizes^] attribute, and is processed in the same
          manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          When multiple {{ImageResource}} dictionaries are available, a user
          agent MAY use the {{ImageResource/sizes}} value to decide which image
          is most suitable for a display context (and ignore any that are
          inappropriate).
        </p>
        <aside class="note">
          When multiple {{ImageResource}} dictionaries are being used by an API
          (e.g., in a WebIDL [=sequence=]), the specifications should indicate
          if the order in which the dictionaries are passed is significant. As
          a general rule, order is significant and "first match wins".
        </aside>
        <div class="example">
          The {{ImageResource/sizes}} member allows for multiple
          space-separated size values in order to accommodate image formats
          (such as ICO) that can act as a container for multiple images of
          varying dimensions.

          The {{ImageResource/type}} member represents an [=image MIME Type=]
          for the image resource. A user agent MAY ignore media types it does
          not support.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no default [=MIME type=] for an {{ImageResource}}. The
          {{ImageResource/type}} is purely advisory. User agents MUST use the
          [=rules for sniffing images specifically=] to determine the
          [=computed MIME type=] of an [=image resource=].

        <p>
          The {{ImageResource/label}} of an {{ImageResource}} is a [=string=]
          that provides the <a data-cite=
          "accname-1.2#dfn-accessible-name">accessible name</a> for the
          associated image.
        </p>

          {{ImageResource}} they expose to users.
        </p>
        <p>
          Authors are strongly encouraged to add a {{ImageResource/label}}
          unless the {{ImageResource}}’s [=accessible name=] can be inferred
          from an <dfn>external label</dfn> in its context. For example, in the
          context of a [=manifest=], the [=manifest/`name`=] (or
          [=manifest/`short_name`=]) provides an [=external label=] for all
          members of the [=manifest/`icons`=] array that don’t have a
          {{ImageResource/label}} defined.
        </p>
        <p>
          If neither an explicit {{ImageResource/label}} nor an [=external
          label=] is provided, but the {{ImageResource/type}} supports
          providing an [=embedded accessible name=], implementors MAY choose to
          defer assigning the {{ImageResource/label}} until the
          {{ImageResource/src}} has been fetched and processed. If the
          {{ImageResource/src}} is found to provide an [=embedded accessible
          name=], implementors MUST update the {{ImageResource/label}} to match
          that value.
