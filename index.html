        This document defines the concept of an "image resource" and a
        corresponding WebIDL {{ImageResource}} dictionary. Web APIs can use the
        {{ImageResource}} dictionary to represent an image resource in contexts
        where an `HTMLImageElement` is not suitable or available (e.g., in a
        Worker).

        <strong>This specification is not stable.</strong> Implementors who are
        not taking part in the discussions will find the specification changing
        out from under them in incompatible ways.

      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        Web applications often accept developer-provided image resources to be
        displayed outside of a HTML document (e.g., in the OS, in the browser
        UI, etc.). This specification defines a WebIDL dictionary that
        describes an image, and from where that image resource can be fetched
        from. The user agent can then use this extra information to choose an
        image that is best suited to display on the end-user's device or most
        closely matches the end-user's preferences or environment.

      <p>
        An <dfn>image resource</dfn> consists of:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <dfn data-dfn-for="image resource">src</dfn>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          A [=URL=] from where to obtain the image data.

        <dt>
          <dfn data-dfn-for="image resource">sizes</dfn>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          A [=string=] representing the sizes of the image, expressed using the
          same syntax as [^link^]'s [^link/sizes^] attribute.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <dfn data-dfn-for="image resource">type</dfn>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          An [=image MIME type=].

        <dt>
          <dfn data-dfn-for="image resource">label</dfn>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          A [=string=] representing the <dfn><a href=
          "https://w3c.github.io/accname/#dfn-accessible-name">accessible
          name</a></dfn> of the image.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        In an API, this is represented as an {{ImageResource}} dictionary.

          required USVString src;

        <h3>
          <dfn>src</dfn> member
        </h3>
        <p>
          The {{ImageResource/src}} of an {{ImageResource}} is a [=URL=] from
          which a user agent can [=fetch=] image data.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>
          <dfn>sizes</dfn> member
        </h3>
        <p>
          The {{ImageResource/sizes}} member is equivalent to a [^link^]
          element's [^link/sizes^] attribute, and is processed in the same
          manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          When multiple {{ImageResource}} dictionaries are available, a user
          agent MAY use the {{ImageResource/sizes}} value to decide which image
          is most suitable for a display context (and ignore any that are
          inappropriate).
        </p>
        <aside class="note">
          When multiple {{ImageResource}} dictionaries are being used by an API
          (e.g., in a WebIDL [=sequence=]), the specifications should indicate
          if the order in which the dictionaries are passed is significant. As
          a general rule, order is significant and "last one wins".
        </aside>
        <div class="example">
          The {{ImageResource/sizes}} member allows for multiple
          space-separated size values in order to accommodate image formats
          (such as ICO) that can act as a container for multiple images of
          varying dimensions.
          <pre class="js">
            const image = {
              src: "path/to/image.ico",
              sizes: "16x16 32x32 64x64",
              type: "image/vnd.microsoft.icon",
            };
            some.api.doSomething(image);

      <section>
        <h3>
          <dfn>type</dfn> member
        </h3>
        <p>
          The {{ImageResource/type}} member represents an [=image MIME Type=]
          for the image resource. A user agent MAY ignore media types it does
          not support.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no default [=MIME type=] for an {{ImageResource}}. The
          {{ImageResource/type}} is purely advisory. User agents MUST use the
          [=rules for sniffing images specifically=] to determine the
          [=computed MIME type=] of an [=image resource=].
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>
          <dfn>label</dfn> member
        </h3>
        <p>
          The {{ImageResource/label}} of an {{ImageResource}} is a [=string=]
          that provides an <a>accessible name</a> for the associated image.
        </p>
        <p>
          You MUST provide a {{ImageResource/label}} unless the
          {{ImageResource}}'s label can be inferred from an <dfn>external
          label</dfn> in its context. For example, the {{WebAppManifest/name}}
          can act as the {{ImageResource/label}} for any member of the
          {{WebAppManifest/icons}} array.
        </p>
        <p>
          If an explicit {{ImageResource/label}} is not provided, but the
          {{ImageResource/type}} supports providing an <a>accessible name</a>,
          implementors may choose to infer the {{ImageResource/label}} until
          the {{ImageResource/src}} has been downloaded and parsed. If the
          {{ImageResource/src}} is found to provide an <a>accessible name</a>,
          implementors may choose to update the {{ImageResource/label}} to
          match that value.
